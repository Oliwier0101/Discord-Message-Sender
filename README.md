# Discord-Message-Sender

My first application, This is a simple webhook message sender.
I created this in the Visual Studio 2019.

## Description

The application has 4 text fields that can be edited.

The first is WebHook discord, which is required to send messages to the selected channel.

The second is Bot Name, which allows you to set any bot name you want.

The third one is not required, it allows you to set an avatar using a URL.

The set avatar appears on the right side of the application.

The fourth field is the field of the message we want to send.
